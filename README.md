#[Project 1](https://github.com/HanThitNyiNyi/data-analytics/blob/Projects/Bankruptcy.ipynb): Taiwan Bankruptcy Dataset - Explanatory and Predictive Analysis via Logistic Regression 

This was a project I did, using Logistic Regression to provide an explanatory view of financial metrics that were associated with the likelihood of bankruptcy in Taiwanese companies and also utilizing Logistic Regression for predictive capabilities. 

* Dataset is from Kaggle.
* 2 different Logistic Regression models are used, for explanatory and predictive use. 


#[Project 2](https://github.com/HanThitNyiNyi/data-analytics/blob/Projects/r-project%20(2).ipynb): Stock Returns of iShares Global Clean Energy ETF and its relationship with US GDP Growth and Brent Crude Oil Price Changes - Time Series Analysis through Vector Autoregression and Impulse Response Functon

I explored correlations on R between time series trends of Clean Energy ETF returns, US GDP growth and crude oil price changes. A vector autoregression model (VAR) is used to incorporate the effects of past changes to contemporary behaviour, which is visualized on an Impulse Response Function (IRF). An IRF simulates the movements of a variable into the future based on a positive increase in another variable. 

* Datasets are derived from the US FRED, Yahoo Finance and Trading Economics.
* A VAR equation is used to identify relationships between lagged and contemporary time series data points. 
* IRF is used to visualize effects into the future of changes in one time series variable on another.
